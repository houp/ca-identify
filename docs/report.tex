\section{Problem definition}

In this research we develop an automated method of identifying a cellular automata rule from spatio-temporal images (i.e. observations of system evolution in time). Such problem in general is of great importance -- we hope to develop a method that could be used to analyze real-world observations and build models based on that.

To examine different methods of constructing such models we start with a simplified version of the problem. Firstly a randomly chosen, one dimensional, binary CA rule $R$ is chosen. Only rules with symmetric neighborhoods with positive radius are considered.
Then a set $S$ of selected initial conditions (states of 1D finite lattice) is formed by randomly filling 0's and 1's. After that each space state $s\in S$ is evolved according to $R$. Exactly $T$ evolutions (iterations) are calculated for each $s\in S$, so for each $s$ we have a spatio-temporal image $i(s)$. This sets our evaluation criteria - we will try to discover the rule $R$ by means of evolutionary computing, relying only on samples $i(s)$.   

We shall use following notation:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $S$ - set of starting conditions,
\item $s\in S$ - selected starting condition,
\item $R$ - cellular automata 1D rule,
\item $rad(R)$ - radius of the neighborhood of rule $R$, 
\item $i(s)$ - spatio-temporal image of starting condition $s$ containing samples for time $t=0,1,\ldots,T$,
\item $|s|$ - count of cells in 1D space of starting state $s$,
\item $i_t(s)$ - state in time $t$ of evolution $i(s)$,
\item $i_{t}(s)[j]$ - is value of $j$-th cell in time $t$ in image $i(s)$,
\item we will use rule symbol $R$ as a function symbol, so that we will write: $R(i_t(s)) = i_{t+1}(s)$. Following this notation applying rule $R$ on state $i(s)$ multiple times ($t$-times) is denoted with: $R^{(t)}(i(s)) = i_t(s)$.
\end{enumerate}


\section{Genetic algorithm}

We start by randomly selecting $N$ rules $r^{0}_i,\ i=1,\ldots,N$,  with radiuses $0< \mathcal{R}_1 \leq rad(r^{0}_i) \leq \mathcal{R}_2$, where $\mathcal{R}_1\leq rad(R)\leq \mathcal{R}_2$. 

Then we evaluate all those rules according to fitness function. For some rule $r$ the fitness function is given by:
\[
fit(r) = \frac{1}{|S|}\sum_{s\in S} 1 - \frac{\sum_{t=1}^{T-1}  2^{-t}\left(\sum_{j=1}^{|s|} |r^{(t)}(i_0(s))[j] - i_{t}[j]|\right)}{|s|(1-2^{-T})}.
\]

Note that for any rule $r$ we have $0\leq fit(r) \leq 1$, and $fit(r) = 1$ if $r = R$ or if $r$ is good enough to fully simulate $R$ on given image set. 

So the goal of genetic algorithm is to maximize $fit$ function, by selecting best matches, reproducing and manipulating them.

\subsection{Selection}

We select rules randomly, with weighted chances based on the fitness (i.e. rules with higher fitness have bigger chances of being picked). For the population of $N$ individuals we select $N/2$ pairs and feed them to crossover procedure, and then mutate each of the effecting organisms.

TODO: describe selection in details.

\subsection{Cross-over}

Crossover between rules $r_1$ and $r_2$ can only happen when $rad(r_1) = rad(r_2)$. It it's the case, than we use one-point crossover. We randomly select a point in rules LUT and cross-over entries in LUT starting from this point. 

In case where $rad(r_1)\neq rad(r_2)$ then we randomly pick one of the rules, and up-scale or down-scale the other one, to match radiuses.

Up-scaling is always possible and its "lossless", since class of rules with bigger radius is richer than those with lower one. Down-scaling on the other hand looses some information of the rule definition.

TODO: add more details on up-scaling and down-scaling implementation.

\subsection{Mutation}

We have 3 types of mutations: LUT entry level mutation, random up-scaling and down-scaling.

First kind of mutation simply switches entries in LUT with some small probability $p_m$.

The additional type of mutations down-scale or up-scale the radius of a rule at random with some small probabilities $p_{down}$, $p_{up}$, to give more diversity to the population and to enable searches in different radiuses.

\subsection{Sucess criteria}

The evolution of genetic algorithm continues with iterative applying of fitness recalculation, selection, cross-over and mutation. In each iteration we additionally keep the best individual from previous iteration without any modifications.

We end the algorithm when there is a rule with $fit(r)=1$ or when a fixed number of iterations elapsed.
